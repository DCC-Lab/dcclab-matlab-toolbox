# dcclab-matlab-toolbox
This is a MATLAB toolbox from the laboratory of Daniel Côté (DCC Lab). It performs a number of very simple tasks, and the design is not to be very high performance: it is designed to be versatile and easy to use.

1) reading and writing multidimensional data (i.e. stacks or maps in microscopy).  It can read 1D,2D,3D,4D stacks in a very wide variety of formats, including separate files, movies, .raw files, .stack files, multi-page TIFFs, etc...
2) It can perform simple raytracing.
3) It has simple image processing tools
